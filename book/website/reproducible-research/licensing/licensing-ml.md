# Machine Learning Model Licenses

Like a software license, a Machine Learning (ML) model license governs the use or redistribution of 
the model or algorithm. However, there are other components to an AI system, which may have their own separate licenses, 
such as [data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-data.html), 
[software](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-software.html), 
or model weights. ML model licenses may restrict or allocate liability associated using the model, component parts, 
and outputs. 

While many ML models may utilise traditional software licensing models (e.g. MIT, Apache 2.0), 
there are a number of ML model-specific licenses that may be developed for a specific model (e.g. OPT-175B license, BigScience RAIL License), 
company (e.g. Microsoft Open AI Model Development agreement), or series of models (e.g. Open RAIL). 
In the most extreme cases, a model developer may choose to grant the license exclusively to a single entity or open every aspect of the model 
to the public domain. 

In summary, the growing list of ML licenses reflects an understanding that ML models and corresponding artefacts are distinct from the code, 
and thus in need of new licensing options. Additionally, due the nature of potential social harms that ML models may enable, 
developers have found value in using ML model licenses as a tool to articulate their intentions for the model and how it is used, 
or as a way to embed community values into the resource.
